# RateMyJS

A Rate My Professor chrome extension for University of Michigan and Stony Brook University students. Professor scores will show up when the user selects their university icon. 

**Note: For University of Michigan Students, the extension will only work on the LSA Course Guide Search Results page.** (Example Shown Below) 

**Note: When travelling to the next page or another LSA Course Guide Search Results page, user must disable and reselect the university icon for ratings for show.** An update will be pushed to resolve this in the future.
